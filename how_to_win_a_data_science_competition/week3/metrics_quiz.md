## What would be a logloss value for a binary classification task, if we use constant predictor f(x) = 0.5? Round to two decimal places.

0.61 (incorrect)

## The best constant predictor for MAE metric is

* Target mode
* 0.5
* **Target 50-th percentile**
* **Target median**
* Target mean

## The best constant predictor for mean squared error is
* **Target mean**
* **Average of the target vector**
* log(y+1)log(y+1), where y is target vector
* Target variance

## The best constant prediction for AUC is
* **Any constant will lead to the same AUC value**
* **0.5**
* **1**
* **Target mean divided by target variance**
* Target median
* Target mean

## Question 5
Suppose the target metric is R-squared. What optimization loss should we use for our models?

* AUC
* **MSE**
* RMSLE
* MAE
* **RMSE**

## Question 6
Calculate AUC for these predictions:
target: 1,0,1,1,1,0,0
prediction: 0.39,0.52,0.91,0.85,0.49,0.02,0.44

0.75
