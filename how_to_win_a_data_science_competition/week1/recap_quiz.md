## Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier belongs to a class of


* Nearest Neighbours based
* Tree-based models
* Neural Networks
* **Linear models**

What is the difference between RandomForest and ExtraTrees models from sklearn?

* **ExtraTrees classifier always tests random splits over fraction of features (in contrast to RandomForest, which tests all possible splits over fraction of features)** This is why they are called extra (randomized) trees
* ExtraTrees classifier always uses only a fraction of objects when looking for a split (in contrast to Random Forest, which uses all object)
* ExtraTrees classifier always uses only a fraction of features when looking for a split (in contrast to Random Forest, which uses all features)


## What model was most probably used to produce such decision surface? Color (from white to purple) shows predicted probability for a point to be of class "red".

* Linear model
* Decision Tree
* **kNN**
* Random Forest
