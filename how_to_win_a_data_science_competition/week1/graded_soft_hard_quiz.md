## Select the correct statements about the RandomForest and GBDT models.


* In RandomForest each new tree is built to improve the previous trees.
* **Trees in RandomForest can be constructed in parallel (that is how RandomForest from sklearn makes use of all your cores)**

* **In GBDT each new tree is built to improve the previous trees.**
