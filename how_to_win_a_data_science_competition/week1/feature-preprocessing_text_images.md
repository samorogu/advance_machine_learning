## TF-IDF is applied to a matrix where each column represents a word, each row represents a document, and each value shows the number of times a particular word occurred in a particular document. Choose the correct statements.


* IDF scales features proportional to the frequency of wordâ€™s occurrences
* **TF normalizes sum of the row values to 1**
* TF normalizes sum of the column values to 1
* **IDF scales features inversely proportionally to a number of word occurrences over documents**


## What of these methods can be used to preprocess texts?


* **Stemming**
* Levenshteining
* **Lowercase transformation**
* Plumbing
* **Lemmatization**
Plumping
* **Stopwords removal**

## What is the main purpose of Lemmatization and Stemming?


* **To reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.**
* To remove words which are not useful.
* To reduce significance of common words.
* To induce common word amplification standards to the most useful for machine learning algorithms form.


## To learn Word2vec embeddings we need ...


* GloVe embeddings
* Labels for each word in the documents in the corpora
* **Text corpora**
* Labels for the documents in the corpora
